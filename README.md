# Drug-repositioning-by-integrating-target-information-through-a-heterogeneous-network-model
Drug repositioning is very important for current drug development, considering the high cost and long time of drug development. Drug
reporsitioning will at least skip the step of test drug toxity. In the paper, 'Drug-repositioning-by-integrating-target-information-
through-a-heterogeneous-network-model. 2014. Bioninformatics'. We put forward a heterogeneous network model by integrating drug-drug
similarity, target-target similarity, disease-disease similarity, known drug-target association and known drug-disease assocation. The code used are upload here.
